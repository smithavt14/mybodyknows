## Development
Began building this app in the spring of 2020 for a friend's brand. We wanted to create a fun quiz that would publish the result on a downloadable poster with a QR code that led to the brand's WeChat Official Account. 

The Mini Program was developed with [Minapp](https://cloud.minapp.com/) as a Backend as a Service (BaaS) and WeChat as the frontend. 

## Challenges
Had most difficulty with the creation of the customized [result at the end quiz](https://github.com/smithavt14/mybodyknows/blob/master/pages/result/result.js). This effect was created using Canvas and can be a bit tricky. You're literally painting elements on the canvas one-by-one to get the desired effect. 

## Next Steps
The application was never published, so unfortunately the product hasn't been used. I'm thinking of using the code to create another Quiz generator application, allowing users to customize questions, answers, background colors, and the images on the downloadable result at the end.
